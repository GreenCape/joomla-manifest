# Joomla Manifest

`joomla-manifest` is a class library for handling Joomla! extension manifest files.

## Installation

### Composer

Simply add a dependency on `greencape/joomla-manifest` to your project's `composer.json` file if you use
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage the dependencies of your project. Here is a minimal example of a
`composer.json` file that just defines a dependency on Joomla Manifest:

    {
        "require": {
            "greencape/joomla-manifest": "*@dev"
        }
    }

For a system-wide installation via Composer, you can run:

    composer global require 'greencape/joomla-manifest=*'

Make sure you have `~/.composer/vendor/bin/` in your path.
